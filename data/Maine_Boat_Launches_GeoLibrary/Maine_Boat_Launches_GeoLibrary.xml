            <abstract>BOATLNCH depicts state-managed and state-assisted boating facility locations throughout Maine at 1:24000 scale or better recorded by the Boating Facilities Division of the Bureau of Parks &amp; Lands. Maine's Bureau of Parks and Lands, Maine's Department of Inland Fisheries &amp; Wildlife and land owners provide access to lakes, ponds, rivers, and the coast at 456 locations. Sites may have gravel or hard-surfaced ramps and may include boarding floats, rest rooms and picnic tables. A few sites have canoe or carry-in access only. Some ramps on tidal waters may be useable only at high tides and are designated "part-tide" facilities. A brochure listing all the boat launches is available by calling (207) 287-4952 or you can view an online version at http://www.state.me.us/doc/parks/programs/boating/index.html .</abstract>
